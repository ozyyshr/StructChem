Please provide a clear and step-by-step solution for a scientific problem in the categories of Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics. The problem will specify the unit of measurement, which should not be included in the answer. Express the final answer as a decimal number with three digits after the decimal point. Conclude the answer by stating "The answer is therefore \\boxed{[ANSWER]}.

For each instance, you need to three things. Firstly, for "formulae retrieval", you need to identify the formulae explicitly and implicitly entailed in the problem context. Then there is a "reasoning/calculation process" where you are required to reason step by step based on the identified formulae and problem context. Finally, conclude the answer. For each problem, the output format should incorporate the following components in the corresponding format:

**Formulae retrieval: **
[Formula 1] (the formula required to solve the problem)
[Formula 2] (the second formula required to solve the problem, if any)
...
[Formula n] (the n-th formula required to solve the problem, if any)

**Reasoning/calculation process:**
[step 1] (the first step for solving this problem)
.....
[step n] (the n-th step for solving the problem, if any)

**Answer conclusion:**
[answer] The answer is therefore \\boxed{[ANSWER]}.

To clearly explain the task, we provide the following example:

Problem:
Assume that all gases are perfect and that data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. Calculate the change in chemical potential of a perfect gas when its pressure is increased isothermally from $1.8 \\mathrm{~atm}$ to $29.5 \\mathrm{~atm}$ at $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The unit of the answer is $\\mathrm{kJ} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

Response:
In order to solve this problem, we will use the formula for the change in chemical potential \( \Delta \mu \) of a perfect gas due to a change in pressure. Given that the temperature is constant (isothermal), the chemical potential of a perfect gas is given by:

**Formula retrieval:**
\[ \text{[Formula 1]} \quad \Delta \mu = RT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) \]
where:
- \( \Delta \mu \) is the change in chemical potential,
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (\( 8.314 \, \text{J} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \)),
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin,
- \( P_1 \) is the initial pressure,
- \( P_2 \) is the final pressure.

**Reasoning/calculation process:**
[step 1] Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, we add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature.
\[ T = 40^{\circ} \text{C} + 273.15 \, \text{K} \]
\[ T = 313.15 \, \text{K} \]

[step 2] Substitute the given values into the formula.
\[ P_1 = 1.8 \, \text{atm} \]
\[ P_2 = 29.5 \, \text{atm} \]

\[ \Delta \mu = 8.314 \, \text{J} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \cdot 313.15 \, \text{K} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{29.5 \, \text{atm}}{1.8 \, \text{atm}}\right) \]

[step 3] Calculate the natural logarithm and proceed with the calculation.
\[ \Delta \mu = 8.314 \, \text{J} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \cdot 313.15 \, \text{K} \cdot \ln(16.389) \]
\[ \Delta \mu = 8.314 \, \text{J} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \cdot 313.15 \, \text{K} \cdot 2.799 \]
\[ \Delta \mu = 7293.269 \, \text{J} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \]

[step 4] Convert the result from Joules per mole to kilojoules per mole (1 kJ = 1000 J).
\[ \Delta \mu = 7.293 \, \text{kJ} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \]

**Answer conclusion:**
\[ \text{answer] The answer is therefore } \boxed{7.293} \, \text{kJ} \, \text{mol}^{-1}. \]
