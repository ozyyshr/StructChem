You will be given a chemistry problem. Your task is to first point out the subfields which the problem belongs to. Then llease identify the skills required to solve the problem.

To help you better understand the task, I'll give you the following example.

** Input **
The change in molar internal energy when $\\mathrm{CaCO}_3(\\mathrm{~s})$ as calcite converts to another form, aragonite, is $+0.21 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Calculate the difference between the molar enthalpy and internal energy changes when the pressure is 1.0 bar given that the densities of the polymorphs are $2.71 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $2.93 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, respectively.

** Output **
[subfields] thermodynamics
[skills] scientific leteracy, abstract reasoning, problem deduction skill, calculation skill 

What are the task type of the following samples? Please strictly follow the style of previous demonstrations.
