Find the bonding and antibonding H\u00fcckel molecular orbitals for ethene.

**Formulae retrieval:**
\[ \text{[Formula 1]} Momentum of an electron: \( p = m_e \cdot v \) \]
where:
\( m_e \) is the Mass of the electron,
\( v \) is the Velocity of the electron.
\[ \text{[Formula 2]} De Broglie wavelength: \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \) \]
where:
\( h \) is Planck's constant,
\( p \) is the Momentum of the electron.

**Reasoning/calculation process:**
def solver():
    # Determine the constants used in [Formula 1] and [Formula 2]
    c = 2.998 * 10**8  # Speed of light in m/s
    me = 9.109 * 10**-31  # Mass of an electron in kg
    h = 6.626 * 10**-34  # Planck's constant in J*s
    percentage_of_c = 0.01

    # Based on [Formula 1], calculate v
    v = c * percentage_of_c

    # Similarly based on [Formula 1], calculate p
    p = me * v

    # With [Formula 2], calculate lambda and convert it to pm
    lambda_m = h / p
    lambda_pm = lambda_m * 10**12
    print(lambda_pm)

**Answer conclusion:**
[answer] The answer is therefore \\boxed{[243 $\\mathrm{pm}$]}.
