Calculating the maximum wavelength capable of photoejection\r\nA photon of radiation of wavelength $305 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ejects an electron from a metal with a kinetic energy of $1.77 \\mathrm{eV}$. Calculate the maximum wavelength of radiation capable of ejecting an electron from the metal.

**Formulae retrieval:**
\[ \text{[Formula 1]} Work function formula: \Phi = h\nu - E_k\]
where:
\( h \) is Planck's constant, 
\( \nu \) is the frequency,
\( E_k \) is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.
\[ \text{[Formula 2]} Formula to find the minimum frequency for photoejection: \nu_{\min} = \frac{\Phi}{h} = \frac{h\nu - E_k}{h}\]
\[ \text{[Formula 3]} Formula to find the maximum wavelength: \lambda_{\max} = \frac{c}{\nu_{\min}} = \frac{c}{\frac{\Phi}{h}} = \frac{c \cdot h}{\Phi} = \frac{c \cdot h}{h\nu - E_k}\]
where:
\( c \) is the speed of light.

**Reasoning/calculation process:**
def solver():
    import scipy.constants as const

    # Given parameters in [Formula 2] and [Formula 3]
    E_k = 1.77 * const.electron_volt  # kinetic energy in J
    lambda_nm = 305  # wavelength in nm

    # Based on [Formula 3], perform calculation
    E_k_over_hc = E_k / (const.h * const.c)  # energy over hc in m^-1
    one_over_lambda = 1 / (lambda_nm * 1e-9)  # reciprocal of wavelength in m^-1

    lambda_max = 1 / (one_over_lambda - E_k_over_hc)  # maximum wavelength in m

    print(lambda_max * 1e9)

**Answer conclusion:**
[answer] The answer is therefore \\boxed{[540 $\\mathrm{~nm}$]}.
