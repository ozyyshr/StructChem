The change in molar internal energy when $\\mathrm{CaCO}_3(\\mathrm{~s})$ as calcite converts to another form, aragonite, is $+0.21 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Calculate the difference between the molar enthalpy and internal energy changes when the pressure is 1.0 bar given that the densities of the polymorphs are $2.71 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and $2.93 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, respectively.

**Formulae retrieval:**
\[ \text{[Formula 1]} The enthalpy change for a transition is given by: \Delta H_m = H_m(\text{aragonite}) - H_m(\text{calcite}) = \{U_m(a) + pV_m(a)\} - \{U_m(c) + pV_m(c)\} = \Delta U_m + p(V_m(a) - V_m(c))\]
where:
\( U_m \) represents the internal energy per mole, 
\( V_m \) is the molar volume, 
\( p \) is the pressure.

**Reasining/calculation process:**
def solver():

    # From the problem, we first determine the constants for the parameters
    p = 1.0e5  
    M = 100  
    rho_a = 2.93  
    rho_c = 2.71  

    # Calculate based on [Formula 1]
    deltaHm_minus_deltaUm = p * M * ((1/rho_a) - (1/rho_c))
    deltaHm_minus_deltaUm = deltaHm_minus_deltaUm * 1e-6

    print(deltaHm_minus_deltaUm) 

**Answer conclusion:**
[answer] The answer is therefore \\boxed{[-0.28 $\\mathrm{~Pa} \\mathrm{~m}^3 \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$]}.
