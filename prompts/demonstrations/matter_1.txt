Estimate the molar volume of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ at $500 \\mathrm{~K}$ and 100 atm by treating it as a van der Waals gas.

**Formulae retrieval:**
\[ \text{[Formula 1]} Conversion of energy from electron volts to joules, given by: E(J) = E(eV) \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} \]
where:
\(E(eV)\) is the energy in electron volts,
\(E(J)\) is the energy in joules.
\[ \text{[Formula 2]} Calculation of frequency using Planck's constant, given by: \nu = \frac{E}{h}\]
where: 
\(\nu\) is the frequency, 
\(E\) is the energy in joules, 
\(h\) is Planck's constant \(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).

**Reasining/calculation process:**
def solver():
    import numpy as np

    # Coefficients of the polynomial
    coeff = [1, -0.453, 3.61e-2, -1.55e-3]

    # Using numpy's roots function to solve the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(coeff)

    # Find the real root that is non-negative and less than 0.410
    Vm = next(root for root in roots if np.isreal(root) and 0 <= root <= 0.410)

    print(Vm.real)

**Answer conclusion:**
[answer] The answer is therefore \\boxed{[0.366 $\\mathrm{dm}^3 \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$]}.
