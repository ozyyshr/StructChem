Please provide a clear and step-by-step solution for a scientific problem in the categories of Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics. The problem will specify the unit of measurement, which should not be included in the answer. Express the final answer as a decimal number with three digits after the decimal point. Conclude the answer by stating "The answer is therefore \\boxed{[ANSWER]}.

For each instance, you need to three things. Firstly, for "formulae retrieval", you need to identify the formulae explicitly and implicitly entailed in the problem context. Then there is a "reasoning/calculation process" where you are required to reason step by step based on the identified formulae and problem context. Answer the question by implementing a solver function "def solver():" in Python. Finally, conclude the answer. For each problem, the output format should incorporate the following components in the corresponding format:

**Formulae retrieval: **
[Formula 1] (the formula required to solve the problem)
[Formula 2] (the second formula required to solve the problem, if any)
...
[Formula n] (the n-th formula required to solve the problem, if any)

**Reasoning/calculation process:**
def solver():
    (code lines and annotation lines.)
    ...
    print(ans) (reason out the final answer "ans".)

**Answer conclusion:**
[answer] The answer is therefore \\boxed{[ANSWER]}.
