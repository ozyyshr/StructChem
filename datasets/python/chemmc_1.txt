# Constants
c = 2.998 * 10**8  # Speed of light in m/s
me = 9.109 * 10**-31  # Mass of an electron in kg
h = 6.626 * 10**-34  # Planck's constant in J*s
percentage_of_c = 0.01

# Calculate v
v = c * percentage_of_c

# Calculate p
p = me * v

# Calculate lambda and convert it to pm
lambda_m = h / p
lambda_pm = lambda_m * 10**12
print(lambda_pm)
