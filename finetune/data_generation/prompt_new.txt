Please help me to generate complex and difficult chemistry problems that lie in the field of physical chemistry and quantum chemixtry.

To help you better understand, I provide the following examples:


Example 1
Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K. Calculate the standard enthalpy of solution of $\\mathrm{AgCl}(\\mathrm{s})$ in water from the enthalpies of formation of the solid and the aqueous ions.

Example 2
Calculating the maximum wavelength capable of photoejection\r\nA photon of radiation of wavelength $305 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ejects an electron from a metal with a kinetic energy of $1.77 \\mathrm{eV}$. Calculate the maximum wavelength of radiation capable of ejecting an electron from the metal.

Following the above examples, please help me with this task and generate three problems that satisfy my requirements. Make sure the generated problems are reasonable and complex for solving.
